            <h2>UNHCR's <i>Strategic Framework on Climate Action</i> and Biopolitical Control</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Anthropogenic climate change is increasing desertification, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and salinization of fresh water sources and agricultural lands (Klepp and Herbeck 2016, 63). At its extreme, unmitigated climate change will make certain geographies uninhabitable and cause both death and displacement. Climate change was officially labelled a threat to global displacement under António Guterres, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the mid-2000s (Felli 2013, 342). Recently, UNHCR released a Strategic Framework for Climate Action to manage the challenges “amplified by the climate emergency” (UNHCR 2020a, 2). This essay explores how the Strategic Framework engages with the two dominant discourses about the populations environmentally displaced, or at risk of environmental displacement, by climate change: the refugee in need of humanitarian aid and the resilient Neoliberal subject.</p>
                <p>Using Foucault’s theory of biopolitics, this essay will demonstrate how environmental development is a mechanism of categorisation that enables the Neoliberal State to control biological mobility. Then, the essay presents an analysis of the rhetoric of the Strategic Framework for Climate Action within the prevailing discourses of environmental refugees and Neoliberal subjects. Through resisting the environmental refugee categorisation, the Strategic Framework asserts UNHCR’s discourse as superior to discourse from the global South and enables the biopolitical control of vulnerable bodies. By promoting the transformation of these vulnerable bodies into resilient subjects—through planned economic migration, risk management, and sustainable development—the Strategic Framework upholds the Neoliberal biopolitical governance of bodies in the global South<span id="dots">...</span></p>

                        <h3>Managing the Resilient Subject</h3>
                            <p>Neoliberal biopower manages populations to increase their economic productivity with limited direct governmental interference, creating the illusion of agency in resilient bodies. Resilience is both the means and the perpetual goal (Bettini 2014, 188), an ideological project based on Neoliberal political and economic rationalities (Reid and Evans 2013, 92). This project promotes adaptation as a practical method to enhance an individual’s capacity to endure change (Geddes et al. 2012, 954). While presented as a method of empowerment (Ibid., 963), the resilience narrative shifts nearly all responsibility from the state onto vulnerable individuals (Bettini, Nash, and Gioli 2017, 350), who must then “bear the cost of their own victimisation” (Tsosie 2007, 1660); this cost is found in the coercive measures masked as adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies depoliticise, develop, and transform the individual into an economically productive, “docile” subject (Bettini 2014, 189-90). In its 19 pages of text, the Strategic Framework references climate resilience or adaptation 18 different times, presenting economic migration, risk management, and sustainable development as adaptive strategies to enhance the resilience of victims, and potential victims, of climate disasters (UNHCR 2020a).</p>
                        <h4>Economic Migration Management</h4>
                            <p>Management of migration does not mean the closure of borders, but a biological separation of functional and dysfunctional mobilities (Bettini 2014, 187). Managed economic migration is biased toward young, healthy men who are discursively imbued with a functional mobility that serves to maximise and diversify Northern incomes (Bettini, Nash, and Gioli, 2017, 353; Felli 2013, 352). The Strategic Framework supports “regional mobility schemes” that give people in vulnerable geographies jobs and help develop long-term solutions (UNHCR 2020a, 14). These schemes are couched in the language of economic empowerment, but divide populations into the developed, productive Neoliberal labourers and undeveloped, mal-adapted idler, denying the political agency of both. Southern geographies and populations are denied as potential sites of political struggle (Felli 2013, 352). Northern states enforce and facilitate these depoliticised labour regimes to assert their biopolitical control and gain productive labourers to fulfil their economic needs. In the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia have established seasonal work programmes with Kiribati, an island predicted to disappear with rising sea levels (Klepp and Herbeck 2016, 67-68). Most tellingly, Australia earmarks its development aid to Kiribati for investment in professional education, making critical aid contingent on generating productive Neoliberal subjects for the Australian labour market before they leave Kiribati (Ibid., 67). In interviews conducted by Klepp and Herbeck (2016), some I-Kiribati viewed these schemes as beneficial only to the young, wealthy, and educated (68). Despite recognising the manipulative practices of the global North, the I-Kiribati’s enforced dependence on the money generated by these schemes (particularly through remittances) and de-politicised status precludes their ability to politically challenge them. Regional mobility schemes promoted by UNHCR are simply biopolitical methods of labour extraction from the South to the North.</p>
                        <h4>Risk Acceptance and Risk Management</h4>
                            <p>To prevent migration that does not economically benefit the North, States promote the resilience of Southern populations. Communities must employ risk-management strategies to increase their capacity to withstand the adverse effects of climate change. According to the Strategic Framework, strengthening community resilience is a high priority for UNHCR and “risks should be taken into account in all preparedness activities, including context analysis, planning, training and capacity building” (UNHCR 2020a, 12). Underpinning risk acceptance is the assumption that risk is quantifiable through measurements and analyses. This produces new mappings of environmental underdevelopment/risk and development/security, according to the global North, and legitimises interventions into the global South (Grove 2010, 552). These interventions may be through the imposition of Northern knowledge, such as UNHCR’s control of refugee categorisation and use of its “protection expertise and [Northern] climate and social science” to develop risk policy in the South (UNHCR 2020a, 19), or through direct action, such as sustainable development infrastructure, which is addressed in the next section.</p>
                            <p>Risk acceptance divides those with the ability to secure themselves from risk from those who must accept their vulnerability (Reid and Evans 2013, 95). The secure have political agency while the vulnerable must constantly work toward achieving security and therefore have no access to political spaces, yet their nominal economic agency means that they are made responsible for themselves. Through risk acceptance, the vulnerable are exposed to increasingly more risk, ensuring their biopolitical death and non-resistance to Neoliberal power structures. Thus, the Strategic Framework repeatedly advocates for the “inclusion” of displaced people in building community resilience, “disaster risk reduction”, and as first responders after an emergency (UNHCR 2020a, 9-13). Individual responsibility and the assumption of a quantifiable risk de-politicises climate change as an environmental phenomenon without geopolitical origins (Felli and Castree 2012, 2). Climate change itself is constructed as something that cannot be resisted, only adapted to, reinforcing the individual’s imperative to be resilient rather than advocate for Northern mitigation strategies.</p>
                            <p>One such path toward resilience is through insurance. According to Foucault (2003), the result of measuring and managing a population is biopolitical control, and insurance is a method of control for those who have fallen outside of the “field of capacity” (243-4). In other words, insurance is a method of managing those who cannot be transformed into productive Neoliberal subjects, whether because of age, disability, injury, or other barriers. Insurance encourages adaptive behaviours to maximise profits for the global North (Grove 2010, 546). While not directly mentioned in the Strategic Framework, Grove (2010) argues that insurance is the logical conclusion of biopolitical management combined with climate science, as it extends the risk of catastrophe—which, in this case, is really the risk of losing Neoliberal economic labourers and the biological threat of unmanaged migration—across the global market and allows for rapid funding for post-disaster rebuilding (540-1). Additionally, remittances from economic migration function as household insurance (Bettini, Nash, and Gioli 2017, 353), encouraging both the household and its wider community to increase their resilience through Neoliberal labour schemes. Directly through its advocacy for labour schemes, and indirectly through its wider call for resilience through risk management, the Strategic Framework discursively justifies and reproduces the Neoliberal exploitation of, and biopolitical control over, the environmentally vulnerable.</p>
                        <h4>Intervention Through Sustainable Development</h4>
                            <img class="blogPhoto1"

                                alt="A split photo of a UNHCR refugee camp in Cameroon. The top shows women in a desert collecting water, while the bottom shows the green farming spaces of the camp.">
                            <p>Sustainable development is the Strategic Framework’s most emphasised strategy of adaptation, with various iterations of sustainability mentioned 33 times throughout the document (UNHCR 2020a). The agency advocates for sustainable development to “enhance self-reliance and economic inclusion of displaced persons” and reduce risk of further displacement or relocation (Ibid., 10). In other words, sustainable development transforms vulnerable geographies into productive Neoliberal spaces and reduces the threat of unmanaged mobility. Therefore, sustainable development is a form of Northern interventionism that creates infrastructures that benefit Northern commercial industries (Hartmann 2010, 239). Grove (2010) argues that the development industry controls biological life by seeking to “secure the circulatory spaces and infrastructure of developed life” (550). Sustainable development enables circulatory labour schemes and divides geography into spaces that are sustainable for human life and those that are not, which map directly onto spaces that are productive for the Neoliberal system, and those that are not. Northern environmental development manages the bodies in the global South to sustain their productivity for the North, rather than the altruistic resilience narrative put forward by UNHCR.</p>

                                style="float:left"

                                alt="A split photo of a UNHCR refugee camp in Bangladesh. The top shows a line of people entering a camp in the desert, while the bottom shows the same camp surrounded by trees and brush.">
                            <p>Sustainable development incorporates previously un-governed spaces into Neoliberal control and reduces the existence of unproductive biological life by greening these spaces. UNHCR’s efforts to increase the sustainability of its field operations is demonstrated in two pairs of pictures (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). In both, a brown landscape populated by displaced people is transformed into a thriving green area devoid of human life, literally erasing the bodies of unproductive subjects for the cause of sustainability. These actions permeate beyond field operations: the Strategic Framework recommends advocacy and involvement in local, regional, and national government to ensure “sustainable natural resource management” and create “reliable, sustainable and modern energy” (UNHCR 2020a, 10). By indirectly accusing local populations of environmental mismanagement (i.e., the environment has not been developed/extracted from according to Northern standards), UNHCR employs the colonial degradation narrative, which imagines destructive Third World peoples who threaten the North via their uncontrolled mobility and rapid population increase (Hartmann 2010, 234). Constructing the global South as environmentally underdeveloped thus constructs it as a threat to Northern biopolitical control which must be neutralised through development interventions. As demonstrated by the paired photographs, indigenous peoples are discursively fated to disappear under sustainable development, just as they were under colonial industrial development (Tsosie 2008, 1675). The history of the removal of indigenous peoples from their land is a history of genocides (Ibid., 1646), which were made possible by biopower’s use of racism to fracture biology (Foucault 2003, 257). Within UNHCR’s discourse, bodies fractured by environmental/“sustainable” development and those that cannot be brought under biopolitical control are murdered by the State through a neo-colonial greening of Southern geography, what Foucault (2003) terms the biopower to “let die” to achieve a purer and healthier life for the superior race (254). Sustainable development as an adaptation strategy is thus, quite literally, a strategy which forces people to adapt according to a Neoliberal subjectivity or perish.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>UNHCR resists the categorisation of the environmental refugee, but in doing so asserts its knowledge as superior and controls the measurement and management of vulnerable populations. The Strategic Framework’s insistence on the self-reliance of the bodies of the vulnerable actually increases their vulnerability by removing their political agency. Instead, through biopower their bodies are either transformed into perpetually adaptive subjects in a quest for resilience, or let die because of their lack of utility for the North. Ultimately, the Strategic Framework on Climate Action’s discourse perpetuates Neoliberal biopolitical control of the global South and increases the vulnerability of those UNHCR ostensibly exists to protect.</p>
                        <p>The construction of an environmentally benign North and destructive South obscures the critical way that Northern production and consumption impacts Southern environmental degradation (Grove 2010, 543). The discourse’s failure to address the causes of climate change—disproportionately Northern pollution—makes sustainable development, and adaptation as an overall strategy, unsustainable both for the Southern bodies literally and biopolitically dying, and for all humanity as dealing with the underlying problem is continuously deferred in favour of Neoliberal biopolitical control. However, power cannot exist without resistance, and many indigenous activists from geographies labelled the most vulnerable are resisting both the environmental refugee and resiliency discourses (see, for example, Tsosie 2007; McAdam 2012; McNamara and Gibson 2009). The construction and reproduction of alternative biology—forms and ways of life—resist Neoliberal biopolitical control. These alternative constructions challenge the Neoliberal system’s core elements of sovereignty and citizenship (Klepp and Herbeck 2016, 71), along which lines environmental development fractures biology. Understanding and investigating alternative biological life as resistance may offer a sustainable solution to the issue of climate change for the entire environment, the natural earth and human bodies alike, without problematising migration as a field of control.</p>

            <h2>The UN, Peacekeeping, and Human Trafficking</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>While multiple organisations have engaged in humanitarian intervention, United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping missions are the most frequent and widely known efforts to intervene based on human rights (United Nations 2017). These missions are generally viewed as positive contributors to the reduction of violence and promotion of peace (Karim 2018, 342). While an important achievement, this evaluation assumes a traditional, physical violence of “deprivation”, measured in destruction and death (Galtung 1969, 168). In contrast, the first section of this paper details a theory of gendered structural violence and a victim-oriented method to evaluate direct impacts of UN Peacekeeping missions. The second section analyses UN policy on preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) by peacekeepers. The third section identifies sex economies and peacekeeper-fathered children (peace babies) as significant consequences of the gendered UN structure, while the last section concludes that peacekeeping reproduces a gendered structure of inequality, making it an inherently violent institution.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>UN Policy</h3>
                <p>The UN’s SEA problem was revealed in the 1990s. In 1993, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was accused of expanding the local sex industry (O’Brien 2011, 805) and drastically increasing rates of HIV among the host population (Jennings 2010, 231). In response to allegations of SEA, Special Representative to the Mission Yasushi Akashi said, “boys will be boys”, implying that assault is simply part of men’s nature (Neudorfer 2016, 286). By the late 1990s, members of the International Police Task Force (IPTF), a component of the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), were accused of SEA and international human sex trafficking, including the former Deputy Commissioner (Murray 2003, 505) and the chief of the internal investigations unit (Westerndorf 2020, 60). A minority of the accused personnel were dismissed from the mission, and none faced criminal charges (Vandenberg 2017, 89). SEA across both missions indicates institutionalised, gendered power relations that allow peacekeepers to harm the population they were meant to protect. It took nearly a decade for the UN to produce policy to prevent and respond to SEA by peacekeepers<span id="dots2">...</span></p>
            </section>
            <span id=expand2>       
                <section> 
                    <h4>Preventative Policy</h4>
                                <p>In 2003, the UN introduced the first annual report on Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, also known as the Zero-Tolerance Policy, which defines and prohibits sexual exploitation and abuse, prohibits sex with minors (under the age of 18), and discourages any “sexual relationships between United Nations staff and beneficiaries of assistance, since they are based on inherently unequal power dynamics” (Annan 2003, emphasis added). The UN is clearly aware of the power disparity between peacekeepers and the local population yet does not fully prohibit it. After the 2005 Zeid Report, which examined peacekeeper SEA and recommended prevention methods (Al-Hussein 2005), the Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations said that the UN must assume SEA “is either a problem or a potential problem in every single one of our missions” (Neudorfer 2016, 286). Much like Galtung’s example of widespread domestic abuse, SEA in every mission clearly demonstrates a structural problem. The policies also isolate women and children as vulnerable populations (Annan 2003, 2.2; Al-Hussein 2005, 10). While women and children are the most affected by peacekeeper abuses, referring to only women and children when discussing SEA makes women and children synonymous with victimhood. This both feminises and infantilises victims in relation to masculinised peacekeepers.</p>
                                <p>The Zeid Report recommends adding more female peacekeepers to facilitate SEA reporting and “to promote an environment that discourages sexual exploitation and abuse” (Al-Hussein 2005, 19). As of August 2020, only 6.6 per cent of all personnel in field missions are women (United Nations 2020c). While the UN’s efforts are unimpressive, their reasoning is more problematic. The first point addresses potential socio-cultural barriers that prevent female victims from discussing sex with men but ultimately rests on the gendered assumption that victims are women and abusers are men. The second point blatantly refers to stereotypes that women are peaceable, non-abusers, and renders them solely responsible for the prevention of SEA (Karim 2018, 341). Thus, the UN’s attempts to prevent structural violence are acts of violence themselves because they reproduce a dangerous gender binary which both prevents men from being seen as victims and removes agency from those who are victims. </p>
                            <h4>Disciplinary Policy</h4>
                                <p>The UN began collecting and publishing data on peacekeeper SEA in 2006 (Karim and Beardsley 2016, 102). This data has become increasingly more specific, disaggregated by mission, allegation, nationality of the perpetrator(s), number of victims, and more (United Nations 2020a). The data, while likely underreported (Westerndorf 2020, 65), demonstrate the scope of the failure of the Zero-Tolerance Policy, which may be due in part to the effective immunity of peacekeepers. The UN’s most severe punishment is repatriation, and home countries must initiate and prosecute criminal charges (Neudorfer 2016, 292). The difficulties of international investigations make prosecutions rare: during the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers used nine children in a sex ring for nearly four years; 114 were repatriated, and none convicted (Lee and Bartels 2020, 181). From 2016, suspended pay of repatriated individuals is directed toward a victim trust fund, which provides assistance and support services to victims and the children born from SEA (United Nations 2020b). Security Council Resolution 2272 introduced the potential for sanctions against troop-contributing countries (TCCs) for peacekeeper SEA, unit repatriation, and bans on TCCs for failing to investigate allegations against repatriated individuals (Neudorfer 2016, 300). Even if this policy were enforced, which is unlikely given the UN’s dependency on TCCs for money and personnel, it is only a deterrent; the UN is still unable to prosecute its personnel, reinforcing the gendered power disparity between the peacekeepers and the local population. </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Structural Effects of Peacekeeping Missions</h3>
                        <p>Direct violence in peacekeeping missions reproduces the violent gendered structures indicated by the UN’s policies above. While there are many routes to explore this violence, the construction of sex economies and the impacts of peace babies are elaborated below. Although not all women are victims and not all victims are women, the local interviewees only discussed women’s issues, limiting the scope of the essay. </p>
                        <h4>Sex Economies</h4>
                            <p>The peacekeeping economy is made of the industries and services born from the arrival of a peacekeeping mission (Jennings 2010, 231). Peacekeepers have significantly more money than their host population: in the UN Mission in Liberia, civilian staff made up to US$6000 per month, while Liberian government workers were paid less than US$300 per month (Aning and Edu-Afful 2013, 22). Massive influxes of cash in an already weak post-conflict economy makes local goods and housing largely unaffordable to locals (Ibid.). The economic disparity between peacekeepers and locals supports the sex trade: women exchange sex for food and other necessities (Lee and Bartels 2020, 200). One woman remembered when children asked UNMIBH peacekeepers “for candy (“gummi, gummi?”); the peacekeepers would respond asking the children to bring their mothers (“mummy, mummy?”)” (Westerndorf 2020, 58). Sexual exchanges are not only common, but even expected in some cases.</p>
                            <p>Of course, some women are economically empowered by peacekeeping economies through business ownership, rebuilding their country’s infrastructure, or benefitting from micro-loan schemes (Aning and Edu-Afful 2013, 24). Some interviewees viewed sexual transactions as necessary survival strategies that saved lives, and perceived the overall peacekeeping economy as positive (Westerndorf 2020, 59). Ultimately, however, the peacekeeping economy is a highly gendered space in which ‘women’s work’ is marginalised and male dominance is asserted (Jennings 2010, 231-233). Women’s work includes the domestic/private spheres; sex is a feminised space for masculinity to violently control. Accordingly, the sex trade is linked to high levels of SEA against women and children (Aning and Edu-Afful 2013, 23). The ‘privacy’ of the act prevents accountability (demonstrated above in UN disciplinary policy). Peacekeepers’ high demand for sex also correlates to international human sex trafficking (Ibid., 24), where victims are controlled through beatings, rapes, and death (Murray 2003, 494). Westerndorf (2020) finds that peacekeeping sex economies outlive the missions themselves, highlighting that individual abuses reinforce structural violence. </p>
                        <h4>Peace Babies</h4>
                            <p>A perhaps less obvious form of violence is found in the proliferation of peace babies. Between the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group and the UN Observer Mission in Liberia, over 30,000 children were fathered by foreigners (Aning and Edu-Afful 2013, 23). Unprompted, more than 10 per cent of the storytelling in Haiti mentioned peace babies (Lee and Bartels 2020, 185). Westerndorf (2020) interviewed locals in Timor-Leste on peacekeeper misconduct, and peace babies were nearly always mentioned first (67). Clearly, the issue is widespread and extremely significant to local people. </p>
                            <p>Fathering a peace baby is a form of socio-economic violence. Whether women choose to be peacekeepers’ “temporary wives” (Westerndorf 2020, 67), or have transactional sex, most do so “in the hope of escaping a poverty trap, which – in the case of children being conceived – only serves to exacerbate economic hardship” (Lee and Bartels 2020, 201). In other words, they do so because the feminised sex act is the only space left. Yet rather than escaping poverty, peace babies compound it. Most women end up raising their children as single mothers, which can bring shame and increase social stigmatisation, limiting socio-economic mobility (Ibid.; Aning and Edu-Afful 2013, 23). In Timor-Leste, some were shunned from their families and forced to enter sex industry to survive (Westerndorf 2020, 78). </p>
                            <p>Many young mothers cannot continue their education, directly affecting their own, their families’, and their communities’ economic success (Lee and Bartels 2020, 191; Westerndorf 2020, 77). Similarly, in Timor-Leste, an incomplete birth certificate impacts peace babies’ future school choice, demonstrating a direct intergenerational impact (Westerndorf 2020, 78). As one man in Haiti put it, “‘The soldiers destroy these young girls’ future by getting them pregnant with a couple of babies and abandon them […which has] a negative impact on the society and on the country in general’” (Lee and Bartels 2020, 189). Peace babies are born from interactions in the gendered spaces between peacekeepers and the local population. The enduring harm they cause demonstrates the structural violence of these interactions.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Modifying Galtung’s (1969) theory of structural violence to include gender provides an important lens with which to view UN humanitarian intervention. It reveals that UN policy on preventing and disciplining peacekeepers violently reproduces the gendered structure of feminised victims and masculinised abusers. Seen through victims’ accounts, peacekeeper sex occurs within the privatised, feminised sphere, promoting SEA as acts of masculine control. The intergenerational, socio-economic violence of sex and SEA is demonstrated through peace babies. Conclusively, UN peacekeeping missions are structurally violent, which raises significant questions on the ethics of intervening at all. </p>
